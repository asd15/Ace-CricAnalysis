# Ace-CricAnalysis
This project is my semester 4 mini-project built with technologies like asp.net and tableau public. It extracts the IPL data from MySql DB and presents in this web application in form of graphs and charts which makes it very easy to analyze any team or player. It can also predict the results of next year.

To run the project, create a new project named CricketAnalysis2 and then in the solution explorer right click on references and select the .dll file fromt the Database folder. Then import the MySql database which is in same Database folder into your localhost server. Run the index file.
